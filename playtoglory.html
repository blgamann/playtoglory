    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      Harena seeks to reshape blockchain gaming by advancing the Play-to-Glory
      (P2G) model. Whereas most blockchain games prioritize monetary rewards
      under Play-to-Earn (P2E), P2G emphasizes intrinsic enjoyment and immersive
      gameplay by reinstating meaningful risk within the Magic Circle. Layer 2
      is employed as enabling infrastructure to make outcomes durable and public
      on-chain and to support sustainable, community-governed growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Magic Circle</h2>

    <p>
      The concept of the Magic Circle, first articulated by Johan Huizinga in
      Homo Ludens and later expanded by scholars such as Eric Zimmerman and
      Frank Lantz, describes the boundary between reality and play. Within this
      space, the ordinary rules of the real world are suspended, and the unique
      rules of the game exclusively govern player behavior and meaning-making.
    </p>

    <h3>Value of the Magic Circle</h3>

    <img src="images/0.png" alt="Magic Circle concept" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 1. The Magic Circle — the boundary between reality and the game
      world
    </div>

    <p>
      The Magic Circle generates distinct social and psychological value. As
      players internalize a game’s rules, they develop skills, experience
      achievement, and cultivate self-respect. Within this protected space,
      cooperation and competition foster camaraderie, belonging, and shared
      purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although the Magic Circle suspends the rules of ordinary reality, the
      meanings it produces often extend beyond the game itself. Experiences
      within play—such as confronting prejudice through the role of an alien
      race in a role-playing game, or navigating deception and trust in a
      strategy board game—can shape real-world perspectives, relationships, and
      identities.
    </p>

    <h3>Revival of the Magic Circle</h3>

    <p>
      In the medieval era, reality and fantasy were deeply intertwined.
      Theology, chivalry, and folklore imbued everyday objects and events with
      symbolic meaning—lilies embodied purity, while mirages were interpreted as
      witchcraft. Rituals and forms of play emerged naturally from these shared
      cultural imaginations.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the advent of modernity, rationalization and scientific progress
      eroded these mythic frameworks. Work and play became sharply separated,
      and adult play diminished, reduced largely to entertainment or leisure
      activities for children.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the contemporary era, however, play has re-emerged as a central
      cultural force. Consumers increasingly seek experiences that transcend
      mere functionality. This shift is reflected in what scholars describe as
      symbolic, aesthetic, and playful forms of capitalism. Products and
      services are no longer designed only for user experience (UX), but also
      for play experience (PX). In this sense, the medieval Magic Circle of
      fantasy has been revived as a modern Magic Circle of symbolic meaning,
      aesthetic immersion, and playful engagement.
    </p>

    <h2>Blockchain Game: From 'Play to Earn' to 'Play to Glory'</h2>

    <p>
      Blockchain games combine gaming with blockchain technology. Games
      inherently aim for fun, while blockchain enables monetization. This
      convergence has produced two distinct models:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Play to Earn (P2E):</strong> Games that emphasize earnings—using
        blockchain mainly to maximize financial returns, where play becomes a
        means to monetary ends.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Play to Glory (P2G):</strong> Games that emphasize glory—using
        blockchain to preserve achievement, recognition, and shared meaning,
        where play itself is the source of value.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To date, most blockchain titles have remained within the P2E paradigm. The
      rise of Axie Infinity demonstrated the short-term viability of P2E, and
      many successors replicated its incentive-driven framework. By contrast,
      P2G seeks to restore play as an intrinsic value, using blockchain to
      protect and strengthen the Magic Circle rather than to commodify it.
    </p>

    <h3>Financialization</h3>

    <p>
      Financialization in blockchain games arises for two primary reasons.
      First, unlike traditional games—where developers and server operators
      maintain full control over economic activity—blockchain games operate
      without centralized regulators, allowing markets to evolve in a
      decentralized and autonomous manner. Second, blockchain significantly
      reduces transaction costs. Smart contracts enable trustless and
      transparent exchanges, where interactions require only minimal network
      fees, thereby encouraging frequent and large-scale economic activity.
    </p>

    <h3>From ‘Labor’ to ‘Play’</h3>

    <p>
      To date, most blockchain games have relied on tokenomics-driven models.
      Investors approach them by calculating return on investment, and in some
      cases players are even hired as paid labor. Because blockchain makes game
      logic and state fully transparent, it also enables the development of
      automated bots. As a result, P2E gameplay often collapses into repetitive,
      mechanized tasks where genuine competition and strategy lose significance,
      and human creativity is eclipsed by algorithmic efficiency.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, P2G games deliberately minimize token-centric mechanics and
      instead emphasize play as an irreducible human activity. Their design
      foregrounds elements that resist automation—unpredictable choices,
      emergent strategies, and creative expression. Most often realized as
      player-versus-player (PvP) formats, P2G games prioritize complexity and
      skill, ensuring that meaningful outcomes depend on human ingenuity rather
      than computational power.
    </p>

    <h3>From ‘Earn’ to ‘Glory’</h3>

    <p>
      In P2E games, play itself is reduced to a form of labor, oriented toward
      monetary gain. Economic incentives dominate design, diminishing intrinsic
      enjoyment and immersion. Players are drawn into repetitive tasks that
      sacrifice creativity and diversity, while incentive structures often
      distort interactions—producing inflation, imbalance, or extractive
      economies.
    </p>

    <p>
      P2G games, by contrast, frame play as the pursuit of glory. Here,
      blockchain functions not only as an economic layer but also as a medium of
      recognition, preserving achievements and legitimizing community respect.
      Success is measured through creativity, strategy, and fair competition,
      with rewards extending beyond currency to include reputation and
      belonging. By privileging enjoyment and achievement over mere financial
      gain, P2G fosters healthier communities and more sustainable growth.
    </p>

    <h1>Blockchain Game: Play to Glory</h1>

    <p>
      In Play-to-Glory (P2G) games, play itself constitutes a meaningful
      practice. Beyond entertainment, it offers players opportunities to
      discover self-worth, identity, and belonging. For such meaning to emerge,
      the Magic Circle must not only be preserved but actively reinforced. Yet,
      the commercial history of gaming has frequently encroached upon this
      circle, compromising the purity of play.
    </p>

    <img src="images/1.png" alt="Game models comparison" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 2. Models of monetization and their impact on the Magic Circle
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Free to Play (F2P):</strong> Games are offered at no cost, but
        revenue is extracted through item purchases or advertisements.
        Developers may deliberately introduce friction and then sell
        convenience, or insert ads that fragment the player’s experience. Such
        practices erode immersion by repeatedly interrupting the flow of play.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pay to Win (P2W):</strong> Games grant paying players
        disproportionate advantages—greater strength, faster progress, or
        exclusive access. This undermines fairness and damages the integrity of
        competition, alienating those unwilling or unable to spend.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Play to Earn (P2E):</strong> Games reward players with financial
        returns for in-game activity. While attractive in the short term, this
        model often reduces play to labor. The pursuit of economic rewards
        incentivizes repetitive tasks, narrowing creativity and undermining
        diversity in gameplay.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sports Business: Protecting the Magic Circle</h2>

    <p>
      Both games and sports establish a Magic Circle that suspends ordinary
      reality and offers pure enjoyment. Yet, while the modern gaming industry
      has often encroached upon this circle—diluting play with intrusive
      monetization—the sports industry has evolved by protecting the integrity
      of play while generating sustainable revenue.
    </p>

    <img src="images/2.png" alt="Sports business model" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 3: Sports economy — a skill-based core and surrounding meta-games
    </div>

    <p>
      In sports, revenue is not extracted from the core game itself but from the
      meta-games that surround it. The core remains skill-based and inviolable,
      while meta-games emerge around it—broadcasting, tournaments, betting,
      sponsorships, and merchandise. Soccer, for instance, is played according
      to fixed rules on the field, but its cultural popularity sustains vast
      industries beyond the game. These meta-games expand proportionally as
      interest in the core game grows, without compromising the fairness or
      meaning of the game itself.
    </p>

    <img src="images/4.png" alt="Gaming business model" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 4: Blockchain gaming — preserving the skill-based core while
      expanding capital-based meta-games
    </div>

    <p>
      Like sports, the gaming industry can separate the core game from its
      surrounding markets. The core game remains skill-based and protected
      within the Magic Circle, while meta-games emerge around it, structured
      primarily through capital. Blockchain offers the ideal infrastructure for
      these meta-games by enabling efficient, transparent, and decentralized
      capital flows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through smart contracts, blockchain removes intermediaries, reduces
      transaction costs, and guarantees security and reliability. This makes it
      possible to build meta-games around the core—much like the revenue
      ecosystems of traditional sports. Yet, because games are inherently more
      malleable than sports, blockchain opens the door to even broader
      experimentation: prediction markets, fan-driven membership tokens, guild
      economies, and other forms of capital-based play that can scale rapidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Crucially, these meta-games must remain complementary to the core. The
      intrinsic enjoyment of the core game drives interest in meta-games, while
      the expansion of meta-games, in turn, reinforces engagement with the core.
      This positive feedback loop enables both layers to co-evolve, generating
      sustainable growth across the gaming ecosystem.
    </p>

    <h2>The Risk of Play: Strengthening the Magic Circle</h2>

    <p>
      The history of gaming began with the arcade era. These games were easy to
      learn yet difficult to master, built on simple rules and intuitive
      controls that made them broadly accessible. Achieving a high score,
      however, demanded sustained practice and skill. A defining feature of this
      era was the presence of risk: players entered with only a limited number
      of lives, and survival depended entirely on ability. Those who excelled
      could extend their playtime and see their names immortalized on
      leaderboards, earning recognition for their achievements.
    </p>

    <img src="images/5.png" alt="Gaming history evolution" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 5: Evolution of gaming from arcade risk-based games to home console
      entertainment
    </div>

    <p>
      As technology advanced, home consoles transformed the medium. Games could
      now be enjoyed in the comfort of one’s home, eliminating the need to
      insert coins and, with it, the constant risk of game over. This shift
      diminished the meaning of defeat and the significance of victory. In
      response, designers began to emphasize storylines, graphics, and sound,
      gradually recasting games as audiovisual experiences that competed less
      with sports and more with movies and television.
    </p>

    <img src="images/6.png" alt="Magic Circle strengthening" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 6: Strengthening the Magic Circle through immersive design and
      community engagement
    </div>

    <p>
      To strengthen the Magic Circle is to preserve a space where actions matter
      under rules distinct from ordinary life. Immersion, collaboration, and
      competition help, but without consequence, immersion is shallow. In
      contemporary design, consequence emerges when outcomes persist and shape
      future experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blockchain enables this persistence by making player outcomes—victories,
      defeats, contributions—permanently and transparently recorded on-chain.
      These durable records can then support a variety of incentive structures:
      recognition within the community, distribution of rewards, or
      qualification for tournaments and events. Because such records are public
      and composable, they can also feed into surrounding meta-games—prediction
      markets, fan memberships, or guild economies—ensuring that each match
      resonates beyond itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this way, Play to Glory (P2G) does not aim to maximize economic return
      but to restore the stakes that make play meaningful. Blockchain allows
      designers to heighten the value of each game session by coupling its
      outcome with durable records and future implications. Defeat regains
      consequence, victory regains significance, and the Magic Circle is not
      only protected but reinforced through the reintroduction of risk.
    </p>

    <h1>Layer 2: Game Subculture</h1>

    <p>
      Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap allows Layer 2 protocols to sustain
      themselves through transaction fees, preserving the neutrality of
      Ethereum’s base layer while enabling diverse projects to operate
      autonomously. In this structure, researchers and developers can pursue
      independent agendas, while still benefiting from Ethereum’s shared
      security and network effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      As semi-autonomous ecosystems, Layer 2 solutions provide fertile ground
      for the emergence of distinct subcultures. Each rollup combines Ethereum’s
      cultural foundations with its own governance models, incentive structures,
      and community norms, gradually shaping a unique identity.
    </p>

    <img src="images/7.png" alt="Layer 2 ecosystem" />
    <div class="caption">
      Figure 7. Layer 2 ecosystem — shared security with cultural
      differentiation
    </div>

    <p>
      Optimism’s vision of the Superchain exemplifies this dynamic: by linking
      the OP Mainnet with other chains into a unified network, it delivers
      scalability and decentralization simultaneously. Such interoperability,
      coupled with atomic cross-messaging and composability, demonstrates how
      Layer 2 can host vibrant subcultures while remaining anchored to the
      broader Ethereum ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the context of gaming, this flexibility positions Layer 2 as an ideal
      environment for game-centered subcultures to emerge. Just as sports have
      historically cultivated unique fan bases, rituals, and meta-games around a
      shared core, blockchain-enabled games on Layer 2 can generate
      self-sustaining communities that treat play not only as entertainment but
      as a cultural practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Games as Public Goods</h2>

    <p>
      In childhood, the simplest resources—a ball, a goalpost, an open
      space—were sufficient to sustain rich play. These public goods nurtured
      cooperation, creativity, and social growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the digital era, however, the economics of game development have
      complicated this dynamic. Building modern games is resource-intensive, and
      commercial pressures often overshadow their cultural and social value. As
      a result, games have struggled to maintain their role as shared public
      goods, increasingly shaped by business interests rather than communal
      meaning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Layer 2 ecosystems offer a pathway to restore this balance. Through
      mechanisms of public funding, transaction fees can be reinvested into the
      creation of games as public goods. Community-driven governance can
      allocate these resources transparently, enabling innovative and
      experimental projects that might not survive under purely commercial
      logics.
    </p>

    <p>
      By treating games as public goods, Layer 2 protocols can onboard diverse
      titles, sustain creative risk-taking, and broaden access to meaningful
      play. In this framing, the value of games is not limited to entertainment
      or profit but extends to their capacity to generate culture, foster
      identity, and strengthen communities.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact = Profit</h2>

    <p>
      Game development demands substantial investment. Within Layer 2
      ecosystems, this need can be met through mechanisms of public funding,
      where community-governed treasuries distribute resources to promising
      projects. Proposals are evaluated against collectively defined criteria,
      and funding decisions are determined through transparent voting. This
      process ensures not only accountability but also active community
      participation in shaping the ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within this model, impact becomes the measure of profit. Core game
      contributors—elite players whose skill inspires others, much like
      Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi in soccer—earn both recognition and
      significant rewards. Their performance and visibility drive engagement
      across the ecosystem, creating aspirational pathways for others to follow.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, meta-game contributors—developers, community managers,
      artists, and organizers—enrich the broader cultural and economic
      environment of play. Their work sustains diversity, nurtures creativity,
      and strengthens community ties. Fair compensation for these roles
      reinforces the health and longevity of the entire system.
    </p>

    <p>
      By distributing rewards proportionally to impact, the Play-to-Glory model
      aligns sustainability with fairness. Economic incentives no longer
      overshadow the value of play but instead amplify it, ensuring that both
      core excellence and supportive contributions are recognized and rewarded.
    </p>

    <h1>Governance: Trust Shift</h1>

    <p>
      In recent years, the center of trust has shifted. People increasingly
      place confidence not in elites or large corporations but in close networks
      and peer communities. Technology has accelerated this shift by enabling
      new forms of trust between strangers—platforms like Airbnb and Uber have
      transformed entire industries by institutionalizing peer-to-peer
      reliability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gaming industry, by contrast, has often struggled with trust.
      Companies prioritize short-term profits, foster exploitative spending, and
      create unfair environments, eroding confidence among players. This dynamic
      undermines not only community well-being but also the long-term
      sustainability of gaming ecosystems.
    </p>

      Figure 8: Trust shift — from corporate centralization to blockchain
      governance
    </div>

    <p>
      Blockchain-based governance reconfigures this trust. Instead of being
      concentrated in corporations, trust is embedded in protocols and smart
      contracts. Rules are transparent, rewards are distributed proportionally
      to contribution, and accountability is built into the system itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      For blockchain games, this shift aligns incentives with community health.
      By rewarding players, developers, and organizers in proportion to their
      impact, the Play-to-Glory model fosters shared growth and durable trust.
      The result is not merely a new business model but a new trust
      architecture—one that treats governance as a common good rather than a
      corporate privilege.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>
      P2G makes games meaningful by reinstating risk and safeguarding the Magic
      Circle. Persist outcomes on-chain, map incentives to those records, and
      let meta-games complement—never distort—the skill-based core. Use Layer 2
      to scale, govern, and fund games as public goods, aligning rewards with
      measurable impact. Adopting this posture shifts blockchain games from
      extraction to culture: play that endures, and glory that matters.
